Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 

Answer: No! In Java, although constructor overloading is allowed, each constructor must have a unique signature. That is, the number and types of the parameters must differ.
- If we try to create constructors with the same parameter types, Java will not be able to distinguish between them and will throw an error. 
- Java does not allow constructors with the same parameter types unless they differ by number or type of parameters.

Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

Answer: Java is passed by value, which means when passing a variable to a method, the method receives a copy of the value of that variable, not the original one.

Question: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?

Answer: The swap method only swaps the local references o1 and o2 within the method. Since Java passes object references by value, the original references (jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD) outside the method are not affected, and their titles remain unchanged.

Question: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

Answer: The changeTitle method modifies the jungleDVD object directly by changing its title to the one passed from cinderellaDVD. Since jungleDVD is passed by reference, the original jungleDVD object is modified within the method.
